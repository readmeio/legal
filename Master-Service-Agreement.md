 3.1  Each party (the “Receiving Party”) understands that the other party (the “Disclosing Party”) has disclosed or may disclose information relating to the Disclosing Party’s technology or business (hereinafter referred to as “Proprietary Information” of the Disclosing Party).  

 3.2  The Receiving Party agrees: (i) not to divulge to any third person any such Proprietary Information, (i) to give access to such Proprietary information solely to those employees with a need to have access thereto for purposes of this Agreement, and (iii) to  take the same security precautions to protect against disclosure or unauthorized use of such Proprietary information that the party takes with its own proprietary information, but in no event will a party apply less than reasonable precautions to protect such Proprietary Information.  The Disclosing Party agrees that the foregoing will not apply with respect to any information that the Receiving Party can document (a) is or becomes generally available to the public without any action by, or involvement of, the Receiving Party, or (b) was in its possession or known by it prior to receipt from the Disclosing Party, or (c) was rightfully disclosed to it by a third party, or (d) was independently developed without use of any Proprietary Information of the Disclosing Party.  Nothing in this Agreement will prevent the Receiving Party from disclosing the Proprietary Information pursuant to any judicial or governmental order, provided that the Receiving Party gives the Disclosing Party reasonable prior notice of such disclosure to contest such order. In any event, Readme.io may collect data with respect to and report on the aggregate response rate and other aggregate measures of the Services’ performance.

 3.3  Customer acknowledges that Readme.io does not wish to receive any Proprietary Information from Customer that is not necessary for Readme.io to perform its obligations under this Agreement, and, unless the parties specifically agree otherwise, Readme.io may reasonably presume that any unrelated information received from Customer is not confidential or Proprietary Information.

 3.4  Both Parties will have the right to disclose the existence but not the terms and conditions of this Agreement, unless such disclosure is approved in writing by both Parties prior to such disclosure, or is included in a filing required to be made by a Party with a governmental authority (provided such party will use reasonable efforts to obtain confidential treatment or a protective order) or is made on a confidential basis as reasonably necessary to potential investors or acquirors.
