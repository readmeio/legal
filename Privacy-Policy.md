* **Account information for third party services:** If you interact with a third party service when using our Services, such as if you use a third party service to log-in to our Services (e.g., Facebook Connect or Twitter OAuth), or if you share content from our Services through a third party social media service, the third party service will send us information about you, such as information from your public profile, if the third party service and your account settings allow such sharing. The information we receive will depend on the policies and your account settings with the third party service.
* **Information from our advertising partners:** We receive information about you from some of our service providers who assist us with marketing or promotional services related to how you interact with our websites, applications, products, services, advertisements or communications.

### Third Party Analytic Tools
Our Services may use third party analytic tools, such as Google Analytics, that use cookies, web beacons, or other similar information gathering technologies to collect standard internet log information and usage information.  The information generated is used to compile statistical reports on user activity.  We will never (and will not allow any third party to) use the statistical reports to track or to collect any personal information of visitors to, or users of, our Services. We will not associate any information gathered from the statistical reports with any personal information from any source. Google Analytics collects information such as how often users visit a website, what pages they visit when they do so, and what other websites they visited prior to coming to a website. We use the information obtained from these applications only to improve our Services and our product and service offerings. The information generated about your use of our Services will be transferred and saved to the vendor’s server in the United States. Google’s ability to use and share information collected by Google Analytics about your visits to the Services is restricted by the Google Analytics Terms of Use and the Google Privacy Policy.

### Cookies
When you visit our sites, we will send you a cookie, which is a small file stored on your computer that allows us to uniquely identify it. Where required by applicable law, we obtain your consent for the use of cookies.  You may choose to delete or not accept our cookies as described in this privacy policy.  If you delete or choose not to accept our cookies, you may not be able to utilize all the features of our products and services.

Just like any other usage information we collect, this information allows us to improve the Services and customize your online experience, and otherwise as described in this Privacy Policy. Your browser may offer you a “Do Not Track” option, which allows you to signal to operators of websites and web applications and services (including behavioral advertising services) that you do not wish such operators to track certain of your online activities over time and/or across different websites.
